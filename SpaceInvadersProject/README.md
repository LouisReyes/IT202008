For my project I am going to use the modded game as a base and mold it
to be my space invaders. If it proves to be too difficult to I will change
it completely if needed.

The Game currenlty meets the requirements for the miletone 2 but it does not
look like space invaders yet it still needs much more work.

Notes to self:
-need to figure out enemies
-need to find out how to make power ups a thing
-need to learn how to link stuff with database (didnt really 
understand this in class tbh)
-html contruction is not too difiicult(refer to youtube tutorials)
-maybe make cutom character models (look into this) if too difficult
just shapes are good enough.


To be honest:
I had no idea how to add most of the features that were on the proposal especially the ones
that were already on there by default. I just was completely lost on how to use the mySQL
database. I have been pretty much lost since the beginning of class when it comes to this stuff.
Its pretty much my fault I guess but the whole not having access to the database while you were 
showing how to use it kind of screwed me over, but whatever I guess. I dont know how to add users, 
or how to even create a simple table. All I know is how to use the html a little. "You shouldve asked
questions in class!" is what you're probably thinking but its kindof awkward asking that while your 
blazing through your code and im kindof shy so I figured might as well try to figure it out on my own 
(that was a huge flop). I am not going to present at all Im too embarrassed and I'd much rather not waste your time.
 After a certain point I felt that it was hopeless to continue working on this project and gave up on it anyway. 
I dont expect much from this assignment gradewise so do your worst I guess, though you've been pretty chill 
so you probably won't drag me through the mud too hard.
