For my project I am going to use the modded game as a base and mold it
to be my space invaders. If it proves to be too difficult to I will change
it completely if needed.

The Game currenlty meets the requirements for the miletone 2 but it does not
look like space invaders yet it still needs much more work.

Notes to self:
-need to figure out enemies
-need to find out how to make power ups a thing
-need to learn how to link stuff with database (didnt really 
understand this in class tbh)
-html contruction is not too difiicult(refer to youtube tutorials)
-maybe make cutom character models (look into this) if too difficult
just shapes are good enough.
